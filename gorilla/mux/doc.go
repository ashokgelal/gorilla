Package gorilla/mux implements a request router and dispatcher.

The name mux stands for "HTTP request multiplexer". Like the standard
http.ServeMux, mux.Router matches incoming requests against a list of
registered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL
or other conditions. The main features are:

* URL hosts and paths can be defined using named variables with an optional
regexp.

* Registered URLs can be built, or "reversed", which helps maintaining
references to resources.

* Requests can also be matched based on HTTP methods, URL schemes, header and
query values or using custom matchers.

* Routes can be nested, so that they are only tested if the parent route
matches. This allows defining groups of routes that share common conditions
like a host, a path prefix or other repeated attributes. As a bonus, this
optimizes request matching.

* It is compatible with http.ServeMux: it can register handlers that implement
the http.Handler interface or the signature accepted by http.HandleFunc().

The most basic example is to register a couple of URL paths and handlers:

	mux.HandleFunc("/", HomeHandler)
	mux.HandleFunc("/products", ProductsHandler)
	mux.HandleFunc("/articles", ArticlesHandler)

Here we register three routes mapping URL paths to handlers. This is
equivalent to how http.HandleFunc() works: if an incoming request URL matches
one of the paths, the corresponding handler is called passing
(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request) as parameters.

Paths can have variables. They are defined using the notation {name} or
{name:pattern}. If a regular expression pattern is not defined, the variable
will be anything until the next slash. For example:

	mux.HandleFunc("/products/{key}", ProductHandler)
	mux.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/", ArticlesCategoryHandler)
	mux.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}", ArticleHandler)

The names are used to create a map of route variables which can be retrieved
calling mux.Vars():

	vars := mux.Vars(request)
	category := vars["category"]

And this is all you need to know about the basic usage. More advanced options
are explained below.

Routes can also be restricted to a domain or subdomain. Just define a host
pattern to be matched. They can also have variables:

	// Only matches if domain is "www.domain.com".
	mux.HandleFunc("/products", ProductsHandler).Host("www.domain.com")
	// Matches a dynamic subdomain.
	mux.HandleFunc("/products", ProductsHandler).
		Host("{subdomain:[a-z]+}.domain.com")

There are several other matchers that can be added. To match HTTP methods:

	mux.HandleFunc("/products", ProductsHandler).Methods("GET", "POST")

...or to match a given URL scheme:

	mux.HandleFunc("/products", ProductsHandler).Schemes("https")

...or to match specific header values:

	mux.HandleFunc("/products", ProductsHandler).
		Headers("X-Requested-With", "XMLHttpRequest")

...or to match specific URL query values:

	mux.HandleFunc("/products", ProductsHandler).Queries("key", "value")

...or to use a custom matcher function:

	mux.HandleFunc("/products", ProductsHandler).Matcher(MatcherFunc)

...and finally, it is possible to combine several matchers in a single route:

	mux.HandleFunc("/products", ProductsHandler).
		Host("www.domain.com").
		Methods("GET").Schemes("http")

Setting the same matching conditions again and again can be boring, so we have
a way to group several routes that share the same requirements.
We call it "subrouting".

For example, let's say we have several URLs that should only match when the
host is "www.domain.com". We create a route for that host, then add a
"subrouter" to that route:

	subrouter := mux.Host("www.domain.com").NewRouter()

Then register routes for the host subrouter:

	subrouter.HandleFunc("/products/", ProductsHandler)
	subrouter.HandleFunc("/products/{key}", ProductHandler)
	subrouter.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}"), ArticleHandler)

The three URL paths we registered above will only be tested if the domain is
"www.domain.com", because the subrouter is tested first. This is not
only convenient, but also optimizes request matching. You can create
subrouters combining any attribute matchers accepted by a route.

Now let's see how to build registered URLs.

Routes can be named. All routes that define a name can have their URLs built,
or "reversed". We define a name calling Name() on a route. For example:

	mux.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}", ArticleHandler).
		Name("article")

Named routes are available in the NamedRoutes field from a router. To build
a URL, get the route and call the URL() method, passing a sequence of
key/value pairs for the route variables. For the previous route, we would do:

	url := mux.NamedRoutes["article"].URL("category", "technology", "id", "42")

...and the result will be an http.URL with the following path:

	"/articles/technology/42"

This also works for host variables:

	mux.Host("{subdomain}.domain.com").
		HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}", ArticleHandler).
		Name("article")

	// url.String() will be "http://news.domain.com/articles/technology/42"
	url := mux.NamedRoutes["article"].URL("subdomain", "news",
										  "category", "technology",
										  "id", "42")

All variable names defined in the route are required, and their values must
conform to the corresponding patterns, if any.

There's also a way to build only the URL host or path for a route:
use the methods URLHost() or URLPath() instead. For the previous route,
we would do:

	// "http://news.domain.com/"
	host := mux.NamedRoutes["article"].URLHost("subdomain", "news").String()

	// "/articles/technology/42"
	path := mux.NamedRoutes["article"].URLPath("category", "technology",
											   "id", "42").String()
